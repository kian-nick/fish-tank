Project Name: 水槽112

Description: This is a fish tank simulator. It has three fish who live inside: David, Mike, and Aidan. These fish use Breadth First Search to find food that the user drops down. There are light physics simulated with collisions and water drag. While you play, there is also nice music playing in the background. This is meant to be enjoyed like an actual fish tank experience; it’s zen. 

How To Run The Project: Make sure all pictures, music, and other folders/files stay in the folder you run “tank.py” from because “tank.py” is where you go to run the game. 

Libraries Needed: cmu_112_graphics
